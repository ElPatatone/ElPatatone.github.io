# Hello, I am Hasanur

After a long period of poor health, I begun to reevaluate what I wanted in life. That
reflection led to the reigniting of my passion for Computer Science.

Right now I am focused on exploring the **foundations of Computing** by peeling 
away at abstraction layers and really understanding how things work using **first 
principles thinking**. 

### Areas I'm actively researching:
- **GPU Computing**
- **Computer Architecture**

👉Curious about what I am working on in detail?  
Check out my [notes](/notes/) or see what I am focused on [here](/now/).
