# Hello, I am Hasanur

After a period of poor health, I took time to reflect on what I truly wanted in life, 
which helped reignite my passion for computer science.

Right now I am exploring the **foundations of Computing** from the silicon
up, with a particular emphasis on **GPU computing**, as well as broader **computer
architecture**. I peel away abstraction layers to understand how systems work at
a foundational level.

**GOAL**: To contribute at the forefront of computing technology, driving innovation
in GPUs and next generation architectures.
<!-- ### Areas I'm actively researching: -->
<!-- - **GPU Architecture & Computing** -->
<!-- - **Computer Architecture** -->

Check out my [notes](/notes/) or see a more detailed breakdown of what I am working on
[here](/now/).
