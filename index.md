# Hello, I am Hasanur

After a long period of poor health, I begun to reevaluate what I wanted in life. That
reflection helped rekindle my passion for Computer Science.

Right now I am focused on exploring the **foundations of Computing** by peeling 
away at abstraction layers and really understanding how things work using **first 
principles thinking**. 

### Areas I'm actively researching:
- **GPU Programming**: CUDA, parallel computing, graphics pipelines, OpenGL
- **Computer Architecture**: CPU/GPU microarchitecture, instruction pipelines, memory 

### You can follow my progress here:
