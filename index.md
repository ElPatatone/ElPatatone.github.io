# Hello, I am Hasanur

After taking time to reflect on my priorities, my passion for computing was reignited.
I have since decided to commit to a career in research.

Right now I am focused on exploring **GPU computing** and how we use modern
hardware to accelerate **AI workloads** to solve real-world problems. 

**GOAL**: To contribute at the forefront of computing technology, driving innovation
in GPUs and next generation architectures to accelerate AI workloads.

Check out my [notes](/notes/) or see a more detailed breakdown of what I am working on
[here](/now/).
