# Hello, I am Hasanur

I am committed to a career in research.

Right now I am focused on exploring **GPU computing** and how we use modern
hardware to accelerate **AI workloads** to solve real-world problems. 

Check out my [notes](/notes/) or see a more detailed breakdown of what I am working on
[here](/now/).
