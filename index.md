# Hello, I am Hasanur

After a period of poor health, I took time to reflect on what I truly wanted in life, 
which reignited my passion for computing.

Right now I am researching computing from the silicon up, with a focus on **GPU
computing** and **computer architecture**. This exploration has also given me a new 
perspective on **AI**. I am working to understand how we use modern hardware to 
accelerate **AI workloads** to solve real-world problems. 

**GOAL**: To contribute at the forefront of computing technology, driving innovation
in GPUs and next generation architectures to accelerate AI workloads.
<!-- ### Areas I'm actively researching: -->
<!-- - **GPU Architecture & Computing** -->
<!-- - **Computer Architecture** -->

Check out my [notes](/notes/) or see a more detailed breakdown of what I am working on
[here](/now/).
