# Hello, I am Hasanur

After a long period of poor health, I begun to reevaluate what I wanted in life. That
reflection led to the reigniting of my passion for Computer Science.

Right now I am focused on exploring the **foundations of Computing** from the silicon
up. I am focused on **GPU architecuture and computing**, as well **computer 
architecture** more broadly, peeling away abstraction layers to understand how 
systems work at a foundational level.

**GOAL**: To work at the forefront of computing technology, driving innovation in GPUs
and next generation architectures.
<!-- ### Areas I'm actively researching: -->
<!-- - **GPU Architecture & Computing** -->
<!-- - **Computer Architecture** -->

Curious to see what I am working on in more detail?  
Check out my [notes](/notes/) or see what I am actively working on [here](/now/).
