# Programming for work:

## What does a software engineer do?

They don't write algorithms

Most are translators:  
business requirements -> code

example:  
Ruby on Rails (or similar) = web apps  
CRUD apps -> Create, Read, Update, Delete

Frontend (View)  
Database (Model)  
Business Logic (Controller)  

A software engineer is very misleading and almost nothing compared to what you learn in school
- learning a binary search algorithm != to what you do at work
- instead you work as a translator for a shitty language aka. business requirements

These are all things you learn at bootcamps.
No one that has only gone to bootcamps will work at companies like COMMA AI where they don't work as translators

AI will soon replace this "Practical programming" paradigm.

Trash work. Monks used to manually copy texts before presses existed. Kind of what these paradigm is like

Most software engineers know nothing about computers
they use heavy frameworks like react and memorize the syntax
