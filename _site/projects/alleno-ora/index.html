<p>I wanted to actually have access to my workout information without having to rely on a
3rd party app. So I made a CLI tool that helps me quickly create and manage workout data, it’s written in C++.</p>

<p>I use a local SQLite database to store that information, making it easy to do data
analysis on it for any metrics you wish to monitor.</p>

<p><strong>(Currently the CLI tool does not have this data analysis functions built in, but it
is planned to be added in the future)</strong></p>
