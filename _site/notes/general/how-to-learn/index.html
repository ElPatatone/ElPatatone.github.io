<p>Beginners are often focused on what to do, but I think the focus should be more on how
much to do.
A believer on the 10’000 hours of work to get good at something</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does not matter where you put it, you will iterate and waste some time but get 
better at it.</li>
  <li>A sense of determinism at picking a thing and putting in 10’000 hours to become an 
expert at it.</li>
  <li>A lot of times beginners compare themselves to other people in the domain, but that
is very hurtful. Only compare yourself from some time in the past and see if you 
have gotten better since.</li>
  <li>A lot of people get paralysed by the choice, what path to take. Worrying about the 
wrong thing.</li>
  <li>You will waste time doing something wrong and you will eventually figure out it is 
not right. You will develop scar tissue and next time you will do it better as you
will already have scar tissue from past failures. Mistakes are not dead work.</li>
  <li>What have you done in the last week?</li>
  <li>Teaching really strengthens your understanding. Not as much of an altruistic
practice. Very beneficial for youself.</li>
</ul>
