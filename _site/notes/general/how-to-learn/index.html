A sense of determinism at picking a thing and putting in 10’000 hours to become an expert at it. A lot of times beginners compare themselves to other people in the domain, but that is very hurtful. Only compare yourself from some time in the past and see if you have gotten better since. A lot of people get paralysed by the choice, what path to take. Worrying about the wrong thing. You will waste time doing something wrong and you will eventually figure out it is not right. You will develop scar tissue and next time you will do it better as you will already have scar tissue from past failures. Mistakes are not dead work. What have you done in the last week? Teaching really strengthens your understanding. Not as much of an altruistic practice. Very beneficial for youself." />
