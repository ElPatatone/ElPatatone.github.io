# {{page.title}}

Right now I am focused on 2 main topics:
- **GPU Programming**: CUDA, parallel computing, graphics pipelines, OpenGL
- **Computer Architecture**: CPU/GPU microarchitecture, ISA 

## GPU Programming

I first got interested in **GPU Programming** in the area of graphics back in 2024,
but I did not actually end up exploring the topic back then.

Now I am actively researching things using the following resources:
- **PMPP (Programming Massively Parallel Processors)** - book
- **CUDA by Example** - book
- **learningopengl.com** - website

## Computer Architecture

This is a more recent passion, after hiding behind abstraction layers I have decided
to remove them and truly understand things. I am interested in a career in the domain
of computer architecture and currently I am using the following resources to kickstart
that process:
- **Digital Design and Computer Architecture** - course by Onur Mutlu available on 
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhxKNlOlRg&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9Eo29LMgKVcaydS7V1zZW3) 
- **Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach** - book
