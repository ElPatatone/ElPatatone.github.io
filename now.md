Right now I am focused on two main topics: 

## GPU Computing

I first got interested in **GPUs** when I was building my first PC, I remember
seeing the name **NVIDIA** for the first time back then and buying an **RTX 2060**
with the only goal being running games at high quality.  

Now, I am researching anything GPU, from GPU microarchitecture to programming on GPUs
using CUDA. I am following several resources but I reccommend these to get started:
- **PMPP (Programming Massively Parallel Processors)** - book/video lectures
- **NVIDIA whitepapers** - great to break down the microarchitecture and design 
                           decisions for different chips
- **CUDA programming guide** - official NVIDIA docs 
- **CUDA by Example** - book

## Computer Architecture

You can't really understand GPUs without understanding the underlying architecture 
behind them. So I am going to explore the foundations of computing from the silicon
upwards. I am using the following resources to guide me:
- **Digital Design and Computer Architecture** - course by Onur Mutlu available on 
[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhxKNlOlRg&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi9Eo29LMgKVcaydS7V1zZW3) 
- **Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach** - book
